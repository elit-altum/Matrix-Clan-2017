               <br>
               Sending separate 3D models which have absolutely no involvement in the video will lead to disqualification.
               <br> 
               The 3D models HAVE TO BE A PART OF THE VIDEO.
               <br> 
               Please note this is NOT A MOVIE MAKING COMPETITION. 
               <br>
               Usage of recorded footage is allowed to a certain extent, but basing your entire video on the same will lead to disqualification.
               <br>

          <br>
          Participants have to make an online contact manager, where a user logs in and can immediately access his contacts, add some, or edit the existing.
          <br>
          Details of the contact should compulsorily have a Profile Picture, Name, Contact Info and Occupation. Other aspects can be added if the participant wishes.
          <br>
          The participants should create a relevant logo and name for their Web service.
          <br>
          The website should have a landing page and at least 4 active links including the Home Page linkage.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>Judgement:</b>
          <br>
          The website should be focused on user experience as the judgement would have maximum points for the same.
          Bootstrap would be allowed for the prelims but not for the finals.
          <br>
          Along with UX, judgement will be based upon originality, aesthetic appeal and UI elements.
          <br>
          Usage of templates will lead to immediate disqualification.
          <br>
          Entries have to be submitted by 2359 15<sup>th</sup> August out of which only 8 teams will qualify for the on site prelims.
          <br>
